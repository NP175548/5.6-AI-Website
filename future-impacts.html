            <h1>Future Impacts of AI</h1>
            <p>The future of Artificial Intelligence holds transformative possibilities for society. As AI continues to evolve, we expect it to revolutionize a wide range of industries, including healthcare, education, and transportation. In healthcare, AI will likely assist in developing personalized treatments and medicines tailored to individual genetic profiles. In education, AI may help create adaptive learning systems that cater to the unique needs of students, enabling more effective and accessible education. Additionally, AI-driven innovations in autonomous transportation could reduce traffic accidents and revolutionize the way goods and people are transported globally. With these advancements, AI has the potential to vastly improve quality of life, but it also raises important questions about job displacement, data privacy, and the ethical implications of AI decision-making.</p>
