            <h1>Future Impacts of AI</h1>
            <p>The future of Artificial Intelligence is brilliant, and it has a lot of promise in bringing transformation into society. While AI will be at the continuous evolution, we expect full revolutions in quite a few industries: healthcare, education, and transportation. In the healthcare sector, AI will most probably help develop personalized treatments and medicines based on the genetic profile of the patients. AI may support, in education, adaptive learning systems that will be tailored to the students' needs and therefore enable a more effective and accessible way of learning. Besides, innovating autonomous transport with the help of AI could potentially reduce road accidents and completely change the ways of goods and people mobility around the globe. These are the advancements that are sure to bring a sea change in the quality of life, but simultaneously raise very critical questions about job displacements, data privacy, and ethics related to AI decision-making.</p>
